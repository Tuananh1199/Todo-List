# Getting Started 

I have completed the requirements of the problem.
In addition, the interface is designed to be responsive and the data is stored in localStorage. 
Besides, I also have additional functions to load data, disable information fields when submitting.
With the search function, i saved the information in params when the user f5 or refreshes the page, the data will be searched by params.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Install the dependencies to the local node_modules folder.

In global mode (ie, with -g or --global appended to the command), it installs the current package context (ie, the current working directory) as a global package.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
